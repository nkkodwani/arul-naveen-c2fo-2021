Welcome to Naveen and Arul's shared GitHub repository! This repo documents our learning process through our Data Analytics internship @ C2FO. 

The main goal of this repository is to share our code with each other in an organized and accessible way. We used Python 3.9.6 / 3.9.5 while learning. Projects included simple Python learning, classes, and functions, but also extended to libraries like Pandas and SQLite. We also learned about and applied programming concepts such as runtime complexity and dynamic programming. 

Both Naveen and Arul started learning Python in the summer of 2021. Arul had some previous academic experience in Java, but Naveen just began coding. In late July, Naveen was given the opportunity to be a Finance intern, so he stopped using this repository. 

NAVIGATION:
- All practice projects and files are stored in the PracticeProjects directory. 
- the 'ArulFiles' directory contains Arul's practice files and projects
- the 'NaveenFiles' directory contains Naveen's practice files and projects. There were no new files in here after Naveen switched to Finance. 
- Practice files we've worked on together are stored in the 'BothFiles' directory

We'd like to thank C2FO and Aditya Devurkar for this internship opportunity. Adi mentored us while learning Python and assisted us with puzzle. We've expanded our technical and professional skills at C2FO, and we both hope to continue our pursuit of Computer Science in the future.
