Welcome to Naveen and Arul's shared GitHub repository! This repo documents our learning process through our Data Analytics internship @ C2FO. 

The main goal of this repository is to share our code with each other in an organized and accessible way. We used Python 3.9.6 while learning. Projects included simple Python learning, classes, and functions, but also extended to libraries like Pandas and SQLite. We also learned about and applied concepts such as runtime complexity and dynamic programming. 

Both Naveen and Arul started learning Python in the summer of 2021. Arul had some previous academic experience in Java, but Naveen just began coding. 

NAVIGATION:
- All practice projects and files are stored in the PracticeProjects directory. 
- the 'ArulFiles' directory contains Arul's practice files and projects
- the 'NaveenFiles' directory contains Naveen's practice files and projects. 
- Practice files we've worked on together are stored in the 'BothFiles' directory
